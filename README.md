### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Lewy. I'm a creative developer, amongst many other things, I'm an artist, circus performer, fire dancer, and ~~acrobot~~ acrobat and I love climbing hills and then running back down them at high speed or on a bicycle. I'm passionate about displaying 3d graphics on the web and my favorite tools for doing so are [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). I'm also passionate open source source software, data privacy, and social/cultural openness and freedom in general. As a great author [once wrote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1889-hello-babies-welcome-to-earth-it-s-hot-in-the-summer), "God damn it, you've got to be kind". We're all on this earth together for a short time so let's create beautiful things and be good to each other while we're here.

Oh and by the way, the picture is out of date. Discover three.js is already here and you can [check out right now](https://discoverthreejs.com/) or even [contribute to it](https://github.com/looeee/discoverthreejs-site), if that takes your fancy.
